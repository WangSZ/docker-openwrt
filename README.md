# nmaas87/docker-openwrt
OpenWRT Dockerfiles and Images for x86, x64, RPi and RPi2.
RPi and RPi2 Images need to be built on Hypriot OS (http://blog.hypriot.com/) and can only be used on ARM Hardware.
While RPi 2 can work with RPi and RPi 2 Images, the RPi Familiy (A/B/A+/B+/Zero/CM) can only work with RPi Images.
x86 and x64 need their plattform to work with.

Original 14.07_x86 and 15.05_x86 where forked from x-drum.

x86 and x64 Images (Versions + Trunk) were retrieved from https://downloads.openwrt.org.
RPi and RPi 2 Images were compiled from their Version and Trunk on 24.03.2016
